# Texas L1 - My First High Power Rocket
*Expected Launch: 22 Nov 2025*

Texas L1 is my first high-power rocket build, created with the purpose of earning a Level 1 High Power Rocketry Certification. Being an active member of [ULAS HiPR](https://www.ulas-hipr.ie/) for 3 years, has taught me the basics of high powered rocktery.

## Mission Brief 
The Tripoli Level 1 (L1) Certification is the first level of internationally recognised high-power rocketry certification offered by the [Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA)](https://www.tripoli.org/Level1). It allows certified individuals to purchase and fly H to I class motors. To earn it, the candidate must build and safely fly a high-power rocket using an H or I motor under supervision, ensuring a stable flight and safe recovery. 

Successful completion demonstrates competence in high-power rocketry, granting permission to participate in higher-powered launches.
